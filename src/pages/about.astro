    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>... and my brand new learning Astro site!</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working my way through Astro's intrtoductory tutorial on
      how to build websites with Astro. This is the second page on my website,
      and it's the first one I built myself, eventhough the words are not
      entirely my own!
    </p>
    <p>
      This site be updated as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      up on it, to see how my journey is going!
