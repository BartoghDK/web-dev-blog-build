# My First Article

Published on: 01-12-2023

Welcome to my _new blog_ about my effort with learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website.

## What I've accomplished so far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.

2. **Making Pages**: Then I learned how to make pages by creating 2 new `.astro` files (blog.astro and about.astro) and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I am doing both Astro pages and Markdown posts! How awesome is that!!

## What's next

The plan is that I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come..

Thanks for reading and have a nice day.
